================

I decided to create a small example of the game: Super mario bros,

for creating the game I'm using a game engine - Andengine (http://www.andengine.org/).

From this example you can easily modify only sprites (or anything else if you want) and create your own game.

If, any questions about Andengine go to http://www.andengine.org/forums/
